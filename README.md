Med Image Scanner is a web-based platform that allows healthcare providers to view and analyze medical images such as X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs. The platform provides tools to view images, annotate them, and perform image analysis using machine learning models. The platform is designed as a companion tool for radiologists and other healthcare providers to help them diagnose diseases. It uses the DICOM standard to retrieve and display medical images from healthcare providersâ€™ Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) servers.
